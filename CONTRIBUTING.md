# Contributing

`cloud-itonami-isco-6340` accepts contributions to the OSS actor, policy tests,
documentation, examples and open occupation blueprint.

## Development

```bash
clojure -M:dev:test
clojure -M:lint
```

Keep changes small and include tests for policy, audit, store or disclosure
behavior.

## Rules

- Do not commit real operator, area or harvest-record data, credentials or
  operating documents.
- Keep production writes and disclosures behind Subsistence Harvest Governor.
- **Never add an op, code path or rationale template that fires a weapon,
  sets or springs a trap, makes a fishing/hunting/gathering-execution
  decision, or makes a kill/harvest-timing decision.** Those actions are
  structurally out of scope for this actor (see
  `src/subsistenceharvest/governor.cljk`'s namespace docstring), not merely
  gated — a PR proposing to add such an op, even behind an escalation gate,
  will be rejected regardless of how it is framed.
- Treat this occupation's workflows as high-risk: add tests for permission,
  purpose, safety and audit logging.
- Document any new business-model or operator assumption in `docs/`.

## Pull Requests

PRs should describe:

- what behavior changed
- which policy invariant is affected
- how it was tested
- whether operator or certification docs need updates
