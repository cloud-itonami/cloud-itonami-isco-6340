# Governance

`cloud-itonami-isco-6340` is an OSS open-occupation blueprint. Governance covers
both code and the operator model.

## Maintainers

Maintainers may merge changes that preserve these invariants:

- the Advisor cannot directly dispatch robot actions or disclose records.
- Subsistence Harvest Governor remains independent of the advisor.
- hard policy violations cannot be overridden by human approval.
- the op-allowlist never gains an op resembling firing a weapon, setting or
  springing a trap, making a fishing/hunting/gathering-execution decision,
  or making a kill/harvest-timing decision — this is a structural
  exclusion, not a policy that can be relaxed by maintainer discretion.
- every commit, hold and approval path is auditable.
- real operator/area/harvest-record data stays outside Git.

## Decision Records

Architecture decisions live in `docs/adr/`. Changes to the trust model,
storage contract, public business model, operator certification, license, or
(especially) the op-allowlist's scope should add or update an ADR.

## Operator Governance

Anyone may fork and operate independently. itonami.cloud certification is a
separate trust mark and should require security, audit, support and data-flow
review.

Certified operators can lose certification for:

- bypassing policy checks
- mishandling operator/area/harvest-record data
- misrepresenting certification status
- failing to respond to security incidents
- hiding material changes to customer-facing operation
- attempting to extend this actor's scope into any weapon-firing,
  trap-setting/springing, fishing/hunting/gathering-execution, or
  kill/harvest-timing-decision function
